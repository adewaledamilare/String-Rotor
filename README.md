String-Rotor
============

Program that rotates any string supplied and computes the number of times the computation is performed

The class “stringEffect” takes a given string and replaces all occurrences of one string with another string, 

returning the number of replacements made.  

It implements a class that does string manipulation.  

For example consider the following code:

stringEffect example;

example(“Microsoft”);

In the above code the output would be “tMicrosof” which shows the last 


character 't' of the string “Microsoft” has been rotated to the left of the string.

This keeps going on and on until the last character has been rotated.
