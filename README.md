String-Rotor
============

Program that rotates any string supplied and computes the number of times the computation is performed

The class “stringEffect” takes a given string and replaces all occurrences of one string with another string, 

returning the number of replacements made.  

It implements a class that does string manipulation.  

For example consider the following code:

stringEffect example;

example(“Microsoft”);

In the above code the output would be “tMicrosof” which shows the last two 


characters of the string “Microsoft” rotated to the left of the string.
